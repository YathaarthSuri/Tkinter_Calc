# Tkinter_Calc
In this project, I have created a simple calculator using Tkinter which is the GUI library of Python.

Calculator performs all sorts of basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer division, exponent.

It also clears the screen as and when required.
